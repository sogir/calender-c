## This code creates a calendar for any year you input. Here's how it works:

Year Input: You type in a year you like.
Leap Year Check: It checks if the year is a leap year (where February has 29 days instead of 28).
Day Calculation: It figures out what day of the week January 1st falls on for that year.
Calendar Display: The code then prints out a month-by-month calendar, showing all the days neatly arranged from Sunday to Saturday.
